<h3>Oyo Ruined My Holidays</h3>

<p>I have had continuous bad experiences with Oyo. Even after complaining they didn't take any actions to fix these issues</p>
<p>After continuous harassment from Oyo, I decided to write about my experience here. We all have families and I don't 
    want anyone else to suffer like me and my family did. I was stranded at 11:30 in New Delhi because hotels I booked
    either kept rejecting the booking or kept denying the check-in or kept asking more money to check-in. Imagine in the
    end getting an Oyo which is not a hotel but more of a brothel. I had to stay at a brothel with my wife because of them.
    
    Similar thing happened in Jaipur and I was stranded for two hours on the road in the summer of April. Hotels kept
    denying the check-in and Oyo kept switching.
    
    And recently in New Delhi again in winter of December, I was denied the check-in by hotel. Hotel said we don't
    have an alliance with Oyo. Worst part is, this time call itself didn't connect to customer support for 50 mins.
    I was left stranded with my wife and 10 month old infant daughter in New Delhi around 7 PM. I raised all these
    concern in past and they just had one resolution, we can refund your money. I mean are you serious, is that
    your resolution. I booked an hotel so that I can stay peacefully and safely. But you made it a nightmare and your
    resolution is refund. I don't want an refund. I want an peaceful and safe stay. If you can't provide that then why
    are you even running this service?
    
    This is just a gist of it. Soon I am gonna write a full blog on all the three incidents along with proofs. My intention
    is not to change your mind. All I want to do is make sure anyone else don't go through these harassments and torture.
